Specifically we are using python 2 instead of python 3 for being more compatible to most of the plug-ins that I am familiar with.

The primary task for today is getting yourselves comfortable with python programming language. This application has a perfect little tutorial for the basic operations.
All documentations can be found online in python.org

Instructions:

1. Open up Pycharm-Edu
2. Click "Introduction to Python"
3. Follow the task list on your left and try to finish as many of them as possible. (Exclude the last two tasks: Modules and packages; File input/output)
4. Be creative and write whatever you want as your very first piece of python code (E.g. printing some pattern, advanced calculator, any type of simulator etc)
5. Post the codes to the WECHAT group to share with the rest of the class
6. Report your status in WECHAT. (Did you finish all of the tasks or where did you get stuck on)

Helpful-tip:
Self-learning is the most essential ability for any type of developer.
If you get stuck with something
    1. Ask the ones around you
    2. Ask Google
    3. Ask me through Wechat (I will not promise to reply)
    4. If it is a problem that really nobody knows, then bomb me with phone calls (18501035804) and I will check Wechat.

Good Luck Everyone and May Force Be With You!
